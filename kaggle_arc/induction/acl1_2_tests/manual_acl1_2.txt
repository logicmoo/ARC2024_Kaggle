                                     ACL
                         Abductive Concept Learning
                                  version 2


Prerequisites:

The following software must be installed in your system:
        Sicstus Prolog: information on how to obtain a commercial licence for Sicstus can
                be found at http://www.sics.se/isl/sicstus.html

Installation instructions:

1) download the ACL1 version 2 code: acl1_2.tar.gz

2) create a directory for your code and data files

3) copy acl1_2.tar.gz into it and decompress it
        gunzip acl1_2.tar.gz
        tar xvf acl1_2.tar
The directory will contain the following files
	manual_acl1_2.txt
this manual,
	acl1_2.pl
	abdpp1.pl
	output.pl
the system, 
	father.bg
	father.rules
an example of input and output files.

Running the system:

1) prepare your data: you need one input file: (see the end of the file for the input file format)
        <file_stem>.bg :the input file with the training set, background knowledge and bias

2) load Sicstus
        sicstus

3) load the acl1 code
        | ?-[acl1_2].

4) start the induction with the command
        | ?-i(<file_stem>).
the induction writes the output files <file_stem>.rules 

Input files format:
Format of <file_stem>.bg: (see father.bg as an example)

   Bias:
   each target predicate must have a "bias" clause
   bias(rule(<head>,<body>),
        [<list of variables>],
        [<list of allowed literals>]).
   The [<list of allowed literals>] is the list of all the possible literals that
   can be added to the rule <head>:-<body>
   <body> is a template that can be used in order to specialize the clauses accordingly to what is already in the body.
        In the example below is a variable so that any rule
        can be refined with the literals in the list.
   The [<list of variables>] must contain the list of all the variables that may
   appear in the rule or its refinements and must be the same for all bias facts relative to    the same predicate.
        Example:
        bias(rule(father(X,Y),_Body),[X,Y,Z],
        [parent(X,Y),parent(Y,X),parent(X,Z),parent(Y,Z),male(X),male(Y),male(Z),
        female(X),female(Y),female(Z)]).

   Abducible predicates:
   abducibles([<list of abducible predicates>]).
   The variables in the abducible predicates must be all different (use _)
        Example:
        abducibles([male(_),female(_)]).

   Integrity constraints: (of the form :-<body>.)
   ic(<list of literals in the body>).
        Example:
        ic([male(X),female(X)]).

   Training set:
   eplus(<list of positive examples>).
   eminus(<list of negative examples>).
        Example:
        eplus([father(john,mary),father(david,steve)]).
        eminus([father(katy,ellen),father(john,steve),father(steve,john),father(steve,katy)]).

   Background theory:
   Rules:
   :-dynamic <pred1>/<arity1>,...,<predn>/<arityn>.
   <definitions for predicates pred1,...,predn>
        Example:
        :-dynamic parent/2, male/1, female/1.

        parent(john,mary).
        male(john).
        parent(david,steve).
        parent(katy,ellen).
        female(katy).

Output files format:
Format of <file_stem>.rules: See for example father.rules:
        /*
        ACL1 ver 2 AbdProofProc. ver 1
        File name: father
        Max spec steps=10, Beamsize=5, Derivation depth=20, Verb
        osity=3
        */
        Execution time 0.310000 seconds. Generated rules

        father(A,B):-parent(A,B),male(A).
        /*Covered positive examples: [father(david,steve),father(john,mary)]
        Covered negative examples: []
        Abduced literals:[[not(father(katy,ellen)),not(male(katy))],
                          [father(david,steve),male(david)]]*/

First the name of the input <file_stem> is printed, then the values for the parameters
are shown together with the total execution time.

Then follows the rules that have been learned, together with the set of positive
and negative examples covered by them and by the set of assumptions made for covering
them. In the set of assumptions, each assumption is associated to the
example that generated it.


Parameters setting:

A number of parameters can be set. The ACL1 parameters are defined by a number of prolog facts and are described below: 

        verbosity(V): specifies the verbosity level.  Set by default to 3
        0: nothing is printed apart from the output rules
        1: every rule that is added to the theory
        2: every rule added to the agenda
        3: the agenda at each specializing step

        beamsize(Beamsize): specifies the size of the beam. Set by default to 5

        nmax(Nmax): maximum number of specializayion.  Set by default to 10

        der_depth(Depth): depth of derivations.  Set by default to 20

        kt(K):  threshold on K+ and K-.  Set by default to 0.1

	min_cov(MC): minimum number of examples that each clause must cover. 
		Set by default to 1.


They can be set either by including a fact for them in the input file, by changing
the acl1_2.pl file and reloading it or by retract and asserts.
